          <p style="font-size:small"><b>Note: You do not need to be
              alarmed!</b> There is not any actual threat of danger besides the insecurity you may be feeling from the
            offer of free music that normally isn't free, and
            this is
            truly not an attempt in any way to defraud or scam you electronically or by any means otherwise. We (as in
            Gadfly
            & G# Movement) are simply acting under
            our idea
            (although possibly a quite delusional idea)
            that any act to actively
            increase the listening audience & general exposure of G# Movement is far more valuable than
            any
            money or royalties that may
            be earned from paid
            streams at this time in our young bands exposure.
