            From the very beginning this album strived to capture the best of
            the very best of the potential that Gadfly & G# Movement has to
            offer, and draws from literally every musical experience we have had
            throughout our entire musical careers. In essence, this album is the
            literal physical manifestation of the greatest musical creation
            Gadfly could ever hope to produce at this point in his career. And
            we now freely & willingly pass this creation, our gift that was
            given to us, that we created in an environment of pure musical
            passion, with the hope that you may experience all of the pleasure &
            joy we each had while creating the music that eventually made its
            way onto this album.
