                                Yes we are giving away our album for free so
                                that as
                                many

                                people listen to

                                free than a thousand for a dollar each and we openly encourage you to torrent, upload,
                                download, email, zip, airdrop, and not just magnet these files as often and frequently

                                While many G# Movement members do many different things for money it is the true dream
                                for many of them to
                                one day use
                                their music
                                as the means for doing so. That being said, because no one in G# Movement has relies on
                                music
                                as thier primary income, therefor money, which while nice, is not their primary desire
                                when it comes
                                to
                                thier
                                music ambitions. Each member would still make & play music whether they were getting
                                paid to do
                                so or
                                not, and
                                it's that desire that
                                guided
                                us on our decision. Not money. Getting
                                our music in front of a larger audience is far more desirable than the mere pennies,
                                knickles,
                                or dimes we may garnish for a few streams on the subscription applications.

                                While the internet brought G# Movement together there have also been some real
                                oppurtunities for members of the group to
                                meet up in real life. In 2017 Gadfly took a roadtrip out East from Michigan to meet
                                up with
                                some band mates, and successfully had a jam session with Matt Mooney at his place in
                                West
                                Virginia. Dom and Gadfly (Zach) are actually cousins, so course they've met, and Gadfly
                                met Chase Holton buying a new phone at the AT&T store, where they would often see each
                                other, and Timmy Jay at a homeless shelter. So yes there have been quite a few real
                                interactions amongst the group. Unfortunately due
                                to some hardships Gadfly had he was away from the computer many times, and sometimes
                                over a
                                year at
                                a time,
                                and this changed the chemistry
                                of G# Movement eventually. But many of the members still make music together outside of
                                G#
                                Movement, and there is still hope
                                that once people recognize this album that
                                there will be some renewed motivation to collaborate and create new music for the
                                old members of
                                the G# Movement.

                                All the members of G# Movement have a publicly available BandLab profile, links

                                <b>Connect</b> section, some more active than others, and in their profile you can
                                access the hundreds of original

                                and collaborations that are available for you to fork, modify, and publish at your own
                                disposal.
                                If you make good music we will want to make music with you, simple as that. If you just
                                want to
                                look a song to see how it was made, or to play around with too, that is fine as well. We
                                are
                                used to giving away our music, it's what has allowed us to meet new musicians, and
                                that's why
                                yes, you can collaborate with any of the members of the band you want, nothing is
                                stopping you.
