                                Yes, the album is truly 100% free. This album is the total collection of the best of

                                of
                                everything Gadfly has ever had to offer as a legitimate album, and it is now free so

                                many
                                people can hopefully share in its experience as possible. Gadfly & G# Movement would
                                rather have
                                a million
                                people listen to
                                our music for
                                free than a thousand for a dollar. We openly encourage you to torrent, upload,
                                download, email, zip, airdrop, and not just magnet these files as often and frequently
                                as you
                                possibly can, and we would literally pay you to do it if we could. Too bad we can't
                                directly pay people to enjoy the sounds that are coming into their ears, but one day
                                this may change.

                                While many G#'ers have done many things for money it is the true dream to one day use
                                music
                                as the means for making it. That being said, no one in G# Movement has relied on music
                                to make their money, and therefor money is not their sole goal when it comes to
                                making
                                music. Each G#'er plays music for thier own personal desire, and it's that desire that
                                has guided
                                each of us on our journey through life with music. Not money. I can't for certain speak
                                for
                                everyone in G# Movement, but I stand to reckon that many of them would agree that
                                getting
                                our music in front of a larger audience is far more desirable than a mere few pennies,
                                knickles,
                                or dimes for some streams.

                                While the internet brought G# Movement together there have also been some real
                                oppurtunities for members of the group to
                                meet up in real life. In 2017 Gadfly took a roadtrip out East from Michigan to meet
                                up with
                                a few band mates if he could, and successfully jammed with Matt Mooney in West
                                Virginia and some other fellow
                                BandLab musicians at that time. But other than that one trip the music is all that keeps
                                G# Movement
                                together. Due
                                to some hardships Gadfly was away from the computer for sometimes over a year at a time,
                                and the chemistry
                                of G# Movement was not great for some time with a decrease in collaborations and output
                                from the group. But many of the members still make music together outside of G#
                                Movement, and there is still hope
                                that once people realize what G# Movement has already done with the work they did on We
                                Shall
                                Prevail that maybe
                                there will be some renewed momentum to collaborate and create new music for actual group
                                of G# Movement.
