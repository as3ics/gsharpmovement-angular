            <p>
              Samuel P Lauzon, Thiago Alves, & Gadfly come together to introduce
              the world to the unique sound of G# Movement with this wonderful
              short piece composition that combines a folky Mandolin with the
              sound from the Grateful Dead. Songs like these are what G#
              Movement truly specializing in. A song with a sound truly like no
              other.

            <h3>03. Live Love (Live)</h3>
            <p>
              Live Love (Live) is a very catchy original improvosational peice
              performed live by Gadfly and a fellow anonymous G# Movement
              contributor. This song has only ever been actually performed a
              single time, but it was luckily captured on a decent iPhone
              recording that managed to make it to the final album release.
              Everything in this one works together to bring you into an
              original and classic jam-band smash. It may have only been
              performed once, but this song will be enjoyed by all for many
              years to come.

            <h3>06. From Your Hand To Mine (Instrumental)</h3>
            <p>
              This track has been singularly Gadfly's most inspiring project
              while collaborating, with contributions from multiple great and
              talented artists all across BandLab. This is the original original
              version, which has qualities that I still can not be replicate to
              this day. An EP of all the different versions of the song inspired
              by this original track is not only possible, but likely warranted
              at some point in my career. The song is originally influenced by
              the Explosions in the Sky song "Your Hand in Mine", which I was
              inspired to play around with after attending the band live in
              concert in beautiful Luxembourgh City.

            <h3>09. Every Day's Not Same</h3>
            <p>
              The evolution of this song still amazes me to this day, especially
              the fact that this song blossomed from an originally rather short
              and brisk original base track, which was of me on acoustic guitar,
              but this song is hands down one of my greatest prides as a
              musician, and with the amazing songwriting contributions of Tobi
              Wats I can honestly say that this song stands for everything that
              I personally stand for. Thank you to all the collaborators that
              worked together to create this gem, especially the gifted keyboard
              and computer contributions of Domenick DeGeorge & Tobi Wats for
              creating the foundation of what has matured into an all-time great
              song.

            <h3>10. Gonna Shake</h3>
            <p>
              Gonna Shake, with the original vocal contributions and songwriting
              contributions of Doug Cowan could easily be the best song G#
              Movement has ever been a part of. G# Movement has aquired quite
              the handful of poppy & catchy tunes, but clearly this song is
              something special, and stands out among the rest. A lock for top
              original, the vocals for this production are straight up fire
              ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ and could easily burn down a small unattended building!
              Please enjoy, and do it loudly, perforably in a convertable, with
              the windows down, the volume up, while weaving in and out of lanes
              on the highway. If there was one G# Movement song that you had to
              place a bet on I would inevitably have to wager on this track to
              take it the extra mile.
