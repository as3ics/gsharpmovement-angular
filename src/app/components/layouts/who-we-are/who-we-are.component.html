            <b>G<sub>#</sub> is the last note of a chromatic scale</b>, but it
            is also the first note of that same scale by being an equivalent
            A<sub>b</sub>. Because of this G# Movement has come to stand for
            <b>the movement of the overturning of time.</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once in a generation the stars align at just the right time through
            mythical forces still unmastered by man and there will be but a
            brief moment where an oppurtunity for an event of pure essence of
            creation can occur; a moment when something that up until that point
            in time had never existed in reality, space, time, and possibly even
            in thought; but then suddenly it <i>would</i> exist, filling entire
            spaces with its presence. You never know what you are going to
            create in these rare moments; it could be something good, or it
            could be something bad. Possibly something really bad. But no matter
            what it is it always is something truly miraculous, for in escence
            its existence is due only to a case of a pure true miracle. I
            believe I have come across one such moment like this in time, and
            what was created for us before, during, and after the grandiose
            moment containing all the splender in all miraculouslness is
            something that is simply too grande not to try and share with
            everyone that will have it, for its cost was simply "nothing more"
            at the time to possess, but with future additives of chance, time,
            pressure, and luck, and the final generation of pure creation is
            none other than the once in a generational musical production of the
            indie folk-rock album
            <b>We Shall Prevail</b>
            by <b>Gadfly & G# Movement</b>.

            Who are these people, one of whom seems to go around naming
            themselves after some sort of fly? Honestly, it truly doesn't matter
            a bit at this current time, but I assure you eventually it will
            matter. And I am figuratively dying to share everything I have
            learned and all I have witnessed with you and anybody else who will
            give me the time to listen. I assure you, I will tell all, all in
            due time.

          <h2>How to Participate with <b>G# Movement</b></h2>
          <p>
            Music is a collaborative process, and none of the material used for
            <b>"We Shall Prevail"</b> would have ever been possible without the
            generous support and contributions of the many individual members of
            G# Movement, many who have been named but some who have not. Reality
            is that every single person in G# Movement was originally a stranger
            to each other at the beginning, and because of this and our belief
            in spreading positivity in the world through participation in music
            collaborations we want to give each and every one of our followers
            the same opportunities to get involved in our actual music creation
            process as everybody else. Yes, you can, and will have the actual
            same opportunities to collaborate with Gadfly & G# Movement in their
            music creating process as they continue their musical journey
            through life. The easiest way to get involved in the process, and
            what is by far my first recommendation for anyone who wants to
            participate in the collective collaborative musical creation process
            is to either have or create an online
            <a href="https://bandlab.com" style="color: red">BandLab</a>
            account. Once you have your account I encourage you to simply make a
            new post where you perform some type of musical talent for you and
            your fellow BandLab peers. Once you make a post I gaurentee you will
            get comment and feedback from the BandLab community. Start making
            new musical connections, which you can do on and off BandLab. If
            ever you happen to have writers-block or simply don't know what to
            do on the BandLab app my next suggestion is for you to go on BandLab
            and spend a little time to find a post by a peer that preferably
            contains a piece of music that you want to be a part of, or you can
            even pick an eligible post at random if you like, but you must fork
            it, and then you must take the time to make and publish your own
            original contributions to the project. After you have made
            contributions in BandLab to the collective musical creation process
            you will almost certainly have posted some original musical content
            that likely has generated its own feedback on BandLab, likely new
            user comments from your published posts. If you still are unsure of
            how to get invloved with BandLab then you are going to have to take
            the process of getting plugged into the BandLab community slower
            than most, and I may be unable to slow down and stay connected with
            you during this adaptation time.

            If you disregard the social aspects of the
            <a href="https://bandlab.com" style="color: red">BandLab</a>
            application and focus solely on BandLabs technical software and
            online services offerings, you will find that by itself BandLab has
            created many useful tools and widgets for creating and manipulating
            audio files. Much of the software BandLab provides of service you
            can get access to for absolutely free through the library, but I
            there are now also paid memberships for BandLab, which I believe are
            mostly focused on providing features of networking, promoting, and
            expanding oneself, but just using BandLab as a notebook for all your
            musical projects is mighty convenient. The software provided for
            MIDI manipulation and the Fx and sounds plugins are always expanding
            and at this point in time are adequate to take on some large-scale
            projects using completely only BandLabs interfaces. BandLab might
            not be winning any sprints in its race to control the music indutry,
            but with some major current splashes such as buying the magazine
            Rolling Stones, increased membership, and the continued advancement
            of their software platform, BandLab has found itself in a position
            where it slowly becoming an effective player in the competitive
            musical industry arena that is successeptable to large biases that
            can drive smaller and medium sized companies out of business
            overnight. I've Been using BandLab since 2016 and depend on them to
            not have to spend hours of my time scraping the dozens of hours of
            many various versions of many multiple projects going back nearly
            half a decade that I have kept in BandLab safely and securely. I
            100% do not work for BandLab, but with a few growing pains, have
            come to appreciate and respect their evolving software package.

            you know because all it takes is an email address, there are endless
            other ways for you to participate in G# Movement. All G# Movement
            songs are open-source, meaning we will not pursue any infrindgement
            actions if you use them in almost any way to create your own music
            to express yourself. We want to spread the magic of music as far and
            wide as we can. Here are some ways you can let music into your life
            and experience the joy of songwriting and performance.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fork a song and make it your own</li>
            <li>Share a project you've been working on</li>
            <li>Sing like no one's listening</li>
            <li>Write a poem</li>
            <li>Try and freestyle for as long as you can</li>
            <li>Play an instrument with someone else</li>

          <p>
            Gadfly & G# Movement stands for everyone and for an all inclusive
            society where no one feels left out, alone, or uncomfortable in
            their own skin. Sometimes just talking to someone is the most
            important thing you can do; sometimes it's playing
            screamo-deathmetal songs at the top of your lungs untill you can't
            scream no more. Who is anyone to decide.
