            G<sub>#</sub> is the last note of a chromatic scale, but it is also
            the first note of that same scale as an A<sub>b</sub>. So G# Movement stands
            for <b>the movement of the overturning of time.</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once in a generation the stars align at just the right time through
            mythical forces still unmastered by man and there will be but a brief moment where an oppurtunity for an
            event of
            pure essence of creation can occur; a moment where something that up until that point in time had never
            existed in thought, reality, or space and it would suddenly exist, metaphorically filling the entire room
            with its presence. You never know what you are going to create; it could be something good, or it could be
            something bad. Really bad.
            But no matter what it is it always is miraculous, for in reality its existence truly is a case of a true
            miracle. I believe
            I
            have traversed one such point of these in time, and what was created at its moment of splender in all
            miraculouslness is
            something that is simply too grande not to share and try and give away, for its cost figuratively was
            nothing more to
            make, but additives chance,
            time, and pressure. The creation that I speak of is the album <b>We Shall Prevail</b> by <b>Gadfly & G#
              Movement</b>. Who are
            those people?
            It honestly doesn't matter at this time, but I will tell all. All in due time.

          <h2>How to Participate in <b>G# Movement</b></h2>
          <p>
            Music is a collaborative process, and none of the material used for <b>"We Shall Prevail"</b> would have
            been possible without the support and contributions of the many individual members of G# Movement. Every
            single person in G# Movement was a stranger at the beginning, and because of this philosophy of sharing and
            spreading music through collaboration Gadfly & G# Movement want to give you the opportunity to get involved
            with the music creation process. The easiest way to get involved now is to create a <a
              href="https://bandlab.com" style="color:red">BandLab.com</a> account, post some music, and start making
            connections. Have a writers-block or don't know what to do on BandLab? Then find a post to fork and make an
            addition to someone elses project. You never know whoes day you'll make by sharing the gift of collaborative
            music making with another.
          </p>

            <a href="https://bandlab.com" style="color: red">BandLab.com</a>,
            you know because all it takes is an email address, there are endless
            other ways for you to participate in G# Movement. All G# Movement songs are
            open-source, meaning we will not pursue any infrindgement actions if
            you use them in almost any way to create your own music to express
            yourself. We want to spread the magic of music as far and wide as we
            can. Here are some ways you can let music into your life and
            experience the joy of songwriting and performance.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fork a song and make it your own</li>
            <li>Share a project you've been working on</li>
            <li>Sing like no one's listening</li>
            <li>Write a poem</li>
            <li>Try and freestyle for as long as you can</li>

          <p>
            Gadfly & G# Movement stands for everyone and for an all inclusive
            society where no one feels left out, alone, or uncomfortable in their own skin. Sometimes just talking
            to someone is the most important thing you can do; sometimes
            it's playing screamo-deathmetal songs at the top of your lungs untill you can't scream no more.
            Who is anyone to decide.
