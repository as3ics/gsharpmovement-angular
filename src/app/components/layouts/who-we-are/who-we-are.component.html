            G<sub>#</sub> is the last note of a chromatic scale, but it is also
            the first note of the same scale as an A<sub>b</sub>. So G# Movement stands
            for <b>the movement of the overturning of time.</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once in a generation the stars align at just the right time through
            mythical forces still unmastered by man and there will be for a moment a brief oppurtunity for a moment of
            pure essence of creation; a moment where something that up until that point in time had never
            existed in thought, reality, or space would suddenly exist, and metaphorically be filling up the room, so to
            speak. You never know what you are going to get; it could be something good, or it could be something bad.
            But no matter what it is always miraculous, for in reality its existence truly is a miracle. I believe I
            have confronted one such point in time, and what was created in its moment of all miraculouslness is
            something that is too good not to give away, for it cost figuratively nothing to make, nothing but chance &
            time. I speak of the album <b>We Shall Prevail</b> from <b>Gadfly & G# Movement</b>. Who are those people?
            It honestly doesn't matter, but I will tell all. All in due time.

            Gadfly & G# Movement stands for everyone and for an all inclusive
            society where no one feels left out or alone. Sometimes just talking
            to someone kindly is the most important thing you can do; sometimes
            it's playing screamo-deathmetal songs till you can't scream no more.
            Who are we to decide.
