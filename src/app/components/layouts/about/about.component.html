          <h2>Who are <b>Gadfly & G# Movement</b></h2>
          <p>
            <b>Gadfly & G# Movement</b> are a group of talented and independant
            musicians who came together over a period in 2016 &
            '17 through a new musically themed social media
            app
            <a href="http://bandlab.com" style="color: red">BandLab</a>. During
            this time many creative collaborations, mostly based on the original
            compositions of Gadfly, were created, explored, and
            posted on BandLab through the various members. G# movement was taking ideas
            and
            transforming them into notably ear-grabbing music with the creative additions from
            the extremely developed and diverse musical talents & abilities of
            the collective G# Movement. This eventually led to the realization in 2019 that there was enough
            studio quality tracks for them to produce what we hope is an
            extraordinary musical album for you today.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During the time in 2017 Gadfly & G# Movement were in the midst of a creative blossom where there
            was
            always new musical projects being started and
            collaborations being perfected from the many idependant musical additions of the group. The environment was
            fueled by
            Gadfly's
            hypo-mania combined with the extremely developed musical
            talents, abilities, and passions from the collective
            membership, which was growing very fast at the time. This period truly was
            a magical time
            filled with many special gifts in the forms of sound & music. Many of
            the projects from this time in 2017 wound up on the final tracks of the inital 2019 release of <b>"We
              Shall
              Prevail"</b> by Gadfly & The G# Movement. This album was
            intented to reflect the best of the best of everything Gadfly had to offer from his work thus far, and was a
            collection of the most polished works from all of Gadfly & G# Movement's collaborations. Tracks
            also making it to the final release of the album include a
            recording dating from back in 2011 as well as a project from Escher House in 2019.
            The remaining tracks
            are comprised from all the projects that
            originated during the notablably creative collaborative period shared
            amongst the various membors of G# Movement in the memorable Summer
            of 2017.

          <p>
            Since its original publication the album has gone through 2
            additional releases that included some welcome, and at times some
            unwelcome modifications to the album. While one of the additional
            releases was planned and intended, one of the additional releases
            was due to the album being pulled from distribution due to the
            prolonged and often bad-timed mental-health issues of Gadfly. The
            2022 Remaster was created to resolve many, if not all, of the
            quality inconsistensies pushed to distribution during the unplanned
            emergency re-release of the original album back in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>G# Movement includes but is not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thiago Alves</li>
            <li>Doug Cowan</li>
            <li>Domenick DeGeorge</li>
            <li>Zach DeGeorge, aka Gadfly</li>
            <li>Chase Holton</li>
            <li>Timmy Jay</li>
            <li>Samuel P Lauzon</li>
            <li>Matt Mooney</li>
            <li>Eli Mwalimu</li>
            <li>The Usual Stoopkid</li>
            <li>Tobi Wats</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of the individual members of G# Movement brings to the mix
            their own expertise, talents, as well as past experiences, and there
            are many different genres of music represented between the artists
            on the album, including but not limited to folk, rock, pop, blues,
            alternative, metal, and others even some hip-hop, all layered
            together and uniquely-expressed in ways that are guarenteed to
            provide pleasurable ear-candy sensations to your sound depraved
            little ear-balls.

          <!-- 
          <p>
            Many of the artists of G# Movement that have contributed to this
            album are still actively making music together as they continue
            their musical journey in life, but we have been unable to connect
            lately in G# Movement like we amazingly did in 2017 to produce the
            amount and quality of songs in this project. This is definitely due
            to some of the negative repurcusions that transpired due to a
            chronic mental illness that Gadfly (Zach DeGeorge) suffers from, and
            the fact that he has been the one spearheading efforts on this
            project until some momentum can be gained.
