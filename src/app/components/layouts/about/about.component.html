          <h2>Who are <b>Gadfly & G# Movement</b></h2>
          <p>
            <b>Gadfly & G# Movement</b> are a group of talented and independant
            musicians who came together over a period in 2016 and
            '17 through a musically themed social media
            website
            <a href="http://bandlab.com" style="color: red">BandLab.com</a>. During
            this time numerous creative collaborations, many based on the original
            compositions of Gadfly, were created, explored, and
            perfected on BandLab through the various members of the group. G# movement was taking ideas
            and
            transforming them into notably ear-grabbing music with the creative additions from
            the extremely developed and diverse musical talents & abilities of
            the collective G# Movement. This eventually led to the realization in 2019 that there were enough
            studio quality tracks for them to produce what we hope is an
            extraordinary musical album for you today.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During this time in 2017 Gadfly & G# Movement were in the midst of a creative blossom where there
            were
            always new musical ideas being shared and
            collaborations perfected amonst the many members of the group. The creative environment was
            fueled by
            Gadfly's
            hypo-mania combined with the extremely developed & insane musical
            talents, abilities, and passions of the collective G# Movement
            membership, which was growing steadily and already had many musical genres & styles represented. This period
            truly was
            a magical one
            filled with many special gifts in the forms of sound & music. Many of
            the projects from this time made their way onto the final tracks of the inital 2019 release of <b>"We
              Shall
              Prevail"</b> by Gadfly & The G# Movement. The albums
            intention was to reflect the best of the best of everything Gadfly had to offer from his entire musical
            collection thus
            far,
            and is comprised of his most polished recordings in a
            playlist form
            that he hopes reflects a story of some of the triumphs over obstacles he has had to go through in life.
            Tracks
            making it to the final release include a
            recording dating from back in 2011 with a new vocal rendition as well as an illusive song from some time
            spent at
            Escher
            House in
            2019.
            The remaining tracks of the album
            are almost all comprised from the collaborations that
            originated during the notablably creative period shared
            amongst the members of G# Movement in the Summer
            of 2017. Please enjoy.

          <p>
            Since its original publication the album has gone through 2
            additional releases that included some welcome, and at times some
            unwelcome modifications to the album. While one of the additional
            releases was planned and intended, one of the additional releases
            was due to the album being pulled from distribution due to the
            prolonged and often bad-timed mental-health issues of Gadfly. The
            2022 Remaster was created to resolve many, if not all, of the
            quality inconsistensies pushed to distribution during the unplanned
            emergency re-release of the original album back in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>G# Movement includes but is not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thiago Alves</li>
            <li>Doug Cowan</li>
            <li>Domenick DeGeorge</li>
            <li>Zach DeGeorge, aka Gadfly</li>
            <li>Chase Holton</li>
            <li>Timmy Jay</li>
            <li>Samuel P Lauzon</li>
            <li>Matt Mooney</li>
            <li>Eli Mwalimu</li>
            <li>The Usual Stoopkid</li>
            <li>Tobi Wats</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of the individual members of G# Movement brings to the mix
            their own expertise, talents, as well as past experiences, and there
            are many different genres of music represented between the artists
            on the album, including but not limited to folk, rock, pop, blues,
            alternative, metal, and others even some hip-hop, all layered
            together and uniquely-expressed in ways that are guarenteed to
            provide pleasurable ear-candy sensations to your sound depraved
            little ear-balls.
          </p> -->
          <!-- 
          <p>
            Many of the artists of G# Movement that have contributed to this
            album are still actively making music together as they continue
            their musical journey in life, but we have been unable to connect
            lately in G# Movement like we amazingly did in 2017 to produce the
            amount and quality of songs in this project. This is definitely due
            to some of the negative repurcusions that transpired due to a
            chronic mental illness that Gadfly (Zach DeGeorge) suffers from, and
            the fact that he has been the one spearheading efforts on this
            project until some momentum can be gained.
